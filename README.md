## What I learned
- The hero section was difficult to build. After searching online, I figured Float was the best option to split the left and right hero image. Responsiveness is a little wacky at around the 1100px mark but I couldn't think of another way to do it because the tablet and mobile hero image was too small and I couldn't get the whole section to scale down before the tablet and mobile hero image would work.
