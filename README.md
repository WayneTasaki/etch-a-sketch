## Built with

<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

## What I learned
- Learned lots about buttons and how you can run functions onclick or onchange.
- Created a range slider for the first time. The project originally called for using a prompt() as the input for how large the grid should be, but I thought a slider is a better UX solution. It was interesting figuring out how to pass the slider value to the function that creates the game board squares.
- Overall this was a great lesson in DOM manipulation.
